            <h2>Kickboxing</h2>
            <p>Kickboxing has been one of my greatest passions since I was 13 years old. While I may no longer be part of a formal club, I'm committed to practicing this sport at home four times a week. It's more than just a physical activity; kickboxing is a way for me to stay fit, relieve stress, and channel my energy. Over the years, it has become an integral part of my life, instilling discipline and focus while keeping me connected to the sport I love.</p>

            <h2>Travelling</h2>
            <p>I've always been passionate about traveling, and my favorite style of exploration is through backpacking and road tripping. To date, I've had the opportunity to visit 19 countries using this adventurous approach. Whether it's traversing stunning landscapes, meeting people from diverse cultures, or uncovering hidden gems off the beaten path, backpacking and road tripping have allowed me to embark on unforgettable journeys and create lifelong memories. It's a travel style that resonates with my sense of adventure and a love for discovering the world.</p>

            <h2>Animals</h2>
            <p>I'm a devoted animal lover, with a special affinity for cows. This deep connection with animals is what led me to become a vegetarian. Whenever I have the chance, I hop on my bike and head towards farms or fields, where I can spend time with these gentle creatures. Whether it's simply observing them, providing care, or even just sharing a moment of peace in their presence, being around cows and other animals brings me immense joy. It's a hobby that not only nourishes my soul but also reflects my commitment to animal welfare and a cruelty-free lifestyle.</p>

            <h2>Theater</h2>
            <p>The love for theater runs deep in my family's genes. My grandpa, who was once the 'schepenen van cultuur' in Antwerp, spent a significant portion of his life immersed in the world of the theater. One of the fondest memories from my childhood was accompanying him to various theater productions. These shared experiences created a strong bond between us. Theater, for me, is not just a passion but a legacy passed down through generations, and a profound connection to my family's history. It's a source of inspiration and a reminder of the cherished moments spent with my grandpa.</p>
